# Streamlined-Analytics
 This repository contains code that streamlines various data analytics processes
 
 The main aim of these domains is to make a holistic end-to-end analysis, starting from feature analysis and data cleaning to deploying a machine learning model. 
 
 EDA highlights a basic outline of the data. The biggest issue that this program solves is to understand the data and build relevant features utilizing categorical, numeric and data-time variables. 
 
 Machine Learning was implemented using PyCaret - an automated ML Package. This builds sophisticated models with minimal code, thereby greatly reducing the time taken for coding but having a very detailed model interpretability.
